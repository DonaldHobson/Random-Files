    "In this paper I introduce a method to train neural networks on only part of their training data.\n",
    "First I introduce a method I like to call splitting the difference. It might be kind of the same as something in another paper, but papers, like code, are easier to write than to read. (At least that one is), so its hard to tell.\n",
    "Either way, The other paper didn't explain the  method very well.\n",
    "Suppose you have a neural network. You have a pair of input images, and wish to explain why it made the difference decisions it made. The following method tracks differences back through the network. By gradient descenting on these differences, it is possible to teach the network about arbitrary subsets of its training data, without teaching it about the rest. \n",

    "\n",
    "This section imports some stuff. It loads the data for the network to be tested on. It also defines a function that normalizes the image, and surrounds it "
